                    may be competing in another area of the product portfolio. Red Hat reserves the right to limit access of any events and early preview to upcoming Red Hat product, service and technology launches from someone who is a potential competitor.
                    We appreciate your willingness to be upfront about your status during the membership onboarding process.</p>

                <h3 class="subheading subheading-red">Who selects the Red Hat Accelerators?</h3>

                  <p>The Red Hat Accelerators program seeks individuals who share their personal views and opinions through social media networks, blogs and/or through the community. If for any reason, a member candidate has any concerns about whether
                    joining the Red Hat Accelerators program may conflict with their current employer's business practices and guidelines, then we encourage them to check with their employer first to ensure they are allowed to participate in the program
                    before accepting membership.</p>
