<h1>Red Hat Terms of Use</h1>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Red Hat Portals and Content.</strong>  
   		<p>Through various Red Hat websites and portals, including but not limited to Red Hat Network, the Red Hat JBoss Customer Support Portal, and the Red Hat Customer Portal (collectively, "Red Hat Portals"), Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") provides you&mdash;as a Red Hat customer&mdash;with access to a variety of software, services, web pages, text, documents, and other works of authorship, images, graphics, audio and video content, forums, discussion groups, blogs, and other content (collectively, the Red Hat Portals and foregoing content are referred to as "Red Hat Content").</p> </li>
	<li><strong>Terms Applicable to Red Hat Content.</strong>  
		<p>In order to access a Red Hat Portal and Red Hat Content, you must be a current Customer of Red Hat or its affiliates&mdash;in other words, you must have active valid subscriptions under the terms of a support subscription agreement (such as the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement) between you and Red Hat and/or a Red Hat affiliate ("Customer Agreement"). Your access to and use of Red Hat Content is subject to these Terms of Use and your Customer Agreement. Some Red Hat Content may have additional terms, license agreements, privacy terms, export terms, subscription agreements, or other terms and conditions ("Additional Terms") that apply to your access to or use of the applicable Red Hat Content. In the event of a conflict, inconsistency, or difference between these Terms of Use and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. Red Hat may revise the Terms of Use at any time without notice to you. The revised Terms of Use will be effective when posted. Your continued use of a Red Hat Portal after changes to the Terms of Use have been published constitutes your binding acceptance of the updated Terms of Use. If at any time the Terms of Use are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of the Red Hat Content.</p>
		<p style="text-transform:uppercase">These Terms of Use and the Additional Terms (where applicable) form a legally binding agreement between you and Red Hat. Therefore, it is important that you read them carefully before accessing any Red Hat Content. In order to use Red Hat Content, you must first agree to these Terms of Use. You may not <strong>access OR use</strong> Red Hat Content if you do not accept these Terms of Use. By using Red Hat Content, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms of Use. If you are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to agree to these Terms of Use on behalf of the legal entity. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, then you may not access or use Red Hat Content.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Trademarks.</strong>  
		<p>The trademarks, logos, trade names, and service marks ("Marks") displayed on Red Hat Content are the property of Red Hat or other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without the prior written consent of Red Hat or such third party which may own the Mark. Please see the Red Hat Trademark Guidelines and Policies at <a href="http://[token:www.redhat.com]/en/about/trademark-guidelines-and-policies" class="mimir-link-warn" title="This content is not included in Mimir.">www.redhat.com/en/about/trademark-guidelines-and-policies</a>, which govern any permitted use of Red Hat Marks.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Copyrights.</strong>  
		<p>Red Hat either owns the copyright and related intellectual property rights in Red Hat Content or has obtained the permission of the owner of the copyrights and related intellectual property rights to make it available to you for the purposes described in these Terms Of Use. You may not reproduce, modify, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on Red Hat-owned Red Hat Content unless you have been specifically authorized to do so by Red Hat or, with regard to any third-party content, by the third-party owners. Red Hat and its affiliates respect the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Use of Software.</strong> 
		<p>Your use of the Software is governed by the terms of any end user license agreement and/or other agreements between you and Red Hat and/or third parties ("License Agreement"). The License Agreements (i) for Red Hat Subscription Software (which is defined as Software (including updates) that Red Hat is contractually required to provide to you under the terms of your Customer Agreement) are contained or referenced in your Customer Agreement and (ii) for Additional Software (which is defined as Software that Red Hat provides to you that is in addition to the Red Hat Subscription Software) are provided to you when you download or access the Additional Software. Your right to continue to access Software from a Red Hat Portal is subject to your continued compliance with the License Agreement(s), your Customer Agreement, any Additional Terms, and, in the case of Additional Software, these Terms of Use.</p>
		<p>SOFTWARE IS WARRANTED, IF AT ALL, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Use of Content.</strong>  
		<p>Red Hat grants you a personal, non-assignable license to use Red Hat Content for your own internal use while you are a Red Hat Customer (as defined in Section 2 above). Distributing any portion of Red Hat Content to a third party, using any Red Hat Content for the benefit of a third party, or using Red Hat Content in connection with software other than Red Hat Software under an active Red Hat subscription are all prohibited. Red Hat authorizes you to display on your computer, download, play, and print the Red Hat Content provided: (a) the copyright notice is not removed, (b) Red Hat Content is not be altered, (c) Red Hat Content is used only for your personal, educational, and non-commercial use in support of your active valid subscriptions to Red Hat products and services and in accordance with your Customer Agreement, (d) you do not further redistribute or copy Red Hat Content, and (e) you comply with any Additional Terms. In the event of a conflict, inconsistency, or difference between this Section 6 and the terms of a License or Customer Agreement, the License or Customer Agreement will control (for example, for Red Hat Content licensed under a Creative Commons License, you will have the rights set forth in the applicable Creative Commons License). If you exceed your authorized use of Red Hat Content (for example, if you use Red Hat Content in support of Software for which you do not have an active valid subscription), you may be required under your Customer Agreement to purchase additional subscriptions to Red Hat products. In addition, your right to continue to access Red Hat Content from a Red Hat Portal is subject to your continued compliance with these Terms of Use, your Customer Agreement, and the Additional Terms.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Confidentiality.</strong>  
		<p>Red Hat Content may contain information that is designated as "confidential," and you agree not to disclose such information without Red Hat's prior written consent.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Submission of Ideas.</strong>  
		<p>Red Hat or any of its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, including ideas for new advertising campaigns, new promotions, new products or technologies, processes, materials, marketing plans, or new product names. Please do not send any original creative artwork, samples, demos, or other works. The sole purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when Red Hat products or marketing strategies might seem similar to ideas submitted to Red Hat. Please do not send your unsolicited ideas to Red Hat or anyone at Red Hat. If despite our request that you not send us your ideas and/or materials, you still send them, please understand Red Hat will not treat them as confidential or proprietary.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Linking.</strong>  
		<p>The Red Hat Portals contain links to other websites and resources and are provided for convenience only. Red Hat has not necessarily reviewed the linked websites and is not responsible for the content or availability of any linked websites. The inclusion of any link to a website does not imply endorsement by Red Hat of the website or their entities, products, or services.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Rules of Conduct.</strong> 
		<p>Your use of Red Hat Content is subject to all applicable laws and regulations, and you agree not to violate such laws and regulations. Any attempt to deliberately damage a Red Hat Portal or Red Hat Content is a violation of criminal and civil laws. Red Hat reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, you agree not to post or transmit through a Red Hat Portal any material or content that violates or infringes in any way the rights of others or solicits, encourages, or promotes the use of illegal substances or activities; which is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, derogatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, bigoted or hateful, profane, scandalous, pornographic, indecent or otherwise objectionable, gives rise to civil or criminal liability, or otherwise could violate any applicable law.</p>
		<p>You may not engage in any activity on a Red Hat Portal that restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the Red Hat Portal or Red Hat Content, whether by "hacking," "cracking," "spoofing," or defacing any portions of a Red Hat Portal. You agree not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any parts of a Red Hat Portal or any user accounts, computer systems, or networks. Access to and use of password-protected or secure areas of a Red Hat Portal is restricted to authorized users only. You agree not to access or use a Red Hat Portal in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair (or interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of) any user accounts, Red Hat computer systems, or Red Hat networks.</p>
		<p>You may not post or transmit through a Red Hat Portal any advertising or commercial solicitations; promotional materials relating to services that are competitive with Red Hat; software or other materials that contain viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses, or other potentially harmful or disruptive components; political campaign materials; chain letters; mass mailings; or spam mail. You may not use any robot, spider, site scraper, or other automatic device or process to retrieve, index, "data mine," or otherwise access Red Hat Content. You may not harvest, collect, or use information about Red Hat Portal visitors.</p></li>
	<li><strong>User Name and Password.</strong>  
		<p>Each individual Customer must have a unique user name and password. For your account on a Red Hat Portal, you must select a user name and password and agree (i) to provide Red Hat with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information; and (ii) to update your information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. Failure to provide accurate information constitutes a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your right to access Red Hat Content.</p>
		<p>You may not select a user name that impersonates someone else, is intended to disguise the user's identity, is or may be illegal, may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights, is vulgar or offensive, or may cause confusion. Red Hat reserves the right to reject any user name in our sole discretion. You agree (1) not to share your password(s), account information, or access to Red Hat Content and (2) that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of password(s) and account information and for all activities that occur under your password(s) or account(s) or as a result of your access to a Red Hat Portal. You agree to immediately notify Red Hat of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Red Hat will not be liable for any loss you incur as a result of someone else using your password and account with or without your permission.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Monitoring.</strong> 
		<p>Red Hat has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the Red Hat Portals to determine compliance with these Terms of Use and any other Additional Terms. Red Hat has the right in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post, or remove any material submitted to or posted on a Red Hat Portal that we find to be in violation of these Terms of Use or otherwise objectionable. You are solely responsible for any information you post, transmit, or otherwise make available on a Red Hat Portal. You acknowledge and agree that Red Hat does not have any liability for any action or inaction with respect to any conduct, communication, or posting on a Red Hat Portal.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Rights in Your Content.</strong> 
		<p>By displaying, publishing, and/or making available for download and use of any content, you represent and warrant that you are the owner of all rights in the content. You further grant Red Hat a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute the content which you submit, post, or display on or through a Red Hat Portal. You agree that this license includes a right for Red Hat to make such content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals with whom Red Hat has relationships for the provision of services and to use such content in connection with the provision of those services. You understand that Red Hat may (a) transmit or distribute the content over various public networks and in various media; and (b) make such changes to the content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services, or media. You agree that this license shall permit Red Hat to take these actions. You confirm and warrant to Red Hat that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the above license.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Export Control.</strong> 
		<p>Red Hat Content may be subject to export control restrictions, and you agree to comply with all applicable export control restrictions. You may not access, download, use, or export Red Hat Content in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations, or in violation of any other applicable laws or regulations. You agree to comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority and not to directly or indirectly provide or otherwise make available Red Hat Content in violation of any these laws or regulations, or without all necessary approvals. Red Hat Content may not be downloaded or otherwise provided or made available, either directly or indirectly, (a) to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, the Crimea region of Ukraine, or any other country or destination subject to U.S. trade sanctions, to individuals or entities controlled by such countries, or to nationals or residents of such countries other than nationals who are lawfully admitted permanent residents of countries not subject to such sanctions; or (b) to Denied persons/entities including but not limited to, persons and/or entities such as those listed on the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entities List, and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") Specially Designated Nationals List. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> 
		<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Red Hat, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, due to or arising out of content that you submit to a Red Hat Portal, your violation of the Terms of Use or Additional Terms, or your violation or infringement of any third party rights.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Disclaimer.</strong>

	<li><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> 
		<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RED HAT NOR ITS AFFILATES IS LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTED ORDERS, OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH A RED HAT PORTAL OR RED HAT CONTENT, EVEN IF RED HAT OR ITS AFFILATES HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADVISED OF, OR REASONABLY COULD HAVE FORESEEN, THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, HOWEVER THEY ARISE, WHETHER IN BREACH OF CONTRACT OR IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES DUE TO (a) THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE RED HAT PORTAL OR RED HAT CONTENT; (b) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON A RED HAT PORTAL, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, MALICIOUS OR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, OR FALSE OR FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS; OR (c) RED HAT CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU MAY DOWNLOAD, USE, MODIFY, OR DISTRIBUTE.</p>

	<li><strong>Term and Termination.</strong> 
		<p>Your right to access Red Hat Content expires automatically when you no longer have valid subscriptions for Red Hat products. In addition, Red Hat may at any time, and without prior notice, limit or terminate your ability to access any or all of the Red Hat Content if: (1) in the exercise of Red Hat's reasonable judgment, you breach any provision of the Terms of Use or Additional Terms (or have acted in manner which demonstrates that you intend to breach, or are unable to comply); (2) Red Hat is required by law to terminate; (3) Red Hat no longer provides access to Red Hat Content to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you access the Red Hat Content; or (4) your relationship with Red Hat changes in a way that affects the Red Hat Content you are entitled to access. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms of Use, the terms of Sections 7, 8, and 13-21 shall continue in effect indefinitely.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Jurisdiction.</strong> 
		<p>The validity, interpretation, and enforcement of these Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms of Use will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue. In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar federal or state laws or regulations exists or is enacted, it will not apply to this Agreement, and the governing law will remain as if such law or regulation had not been enacted.</p></li>
	<li><strong>General Terms.</strong> 
		<p>These Terms of Use together with your Customer Agreement (and, where applicable, the Additional Terms and License Agreement(s)) constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Red Hat and govern your use of Red Hat Content and replaces any prior agreements between you and Red Hat in relation to Red Hat Content. You agree that Red Hat may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email or postings on Red Hat Portals. If one or more of the provisions contained in the Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable in any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding will not impair the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions. Red Hat's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section heading of these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p></li>
