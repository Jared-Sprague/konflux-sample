<h1>Accessibility</h1>

<p>Red Hat is committed to providing equal access to electronic and information technologies. We understand that users of our services may require special considerations due to certain disabilities including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. We also understand that many of our users without such disabilities may choose to access our services from a variety of devices including text browsers or with certain features disabled for security reasons. This policy describes the accessibility standards that we have employed within this site. These standards may be updated periodically.</p>


<h2>Simple, Standard Design</h2>

<p>This site uses simple information architecture. Where possible, we have used standard XHTML tags for document structure (e.g., headings and paragraphs). Non-document structures (e.g., &lt;div&gt;) are used for graphical presentation where absolutely required.</p>


<h2>Images with Alternative Text</h2>

<p>All contextual images are tagged with a text label that provides further details, commonly referred to as an "alt" tag. This label is useful for screen readers and users who have disabled image loading.</p>


<h2>Relative Font Sizing</h2>

<p>Most of the textual content provided by this site is presented using a relative size, enabling users to increase the size if desired.</p>


<h2>List-based Navigation</h2>

<p>List structures are used for programming site navigation because they can be more easily processed by screen readers and users who have disabled or custom graphical presentations. The use of lists is generally transparent to users viewing the site in a web browser because the browser transforms and styles the list according to our presentation rules.</p>


<h2>Style Sheets</h2>

<p>All of our custom presentation is defined in cascading style sheets (CSS). CSS is a technology that enables screen readers, web browsers, or any other "client" to render the content specific to that device. CSS also allows users to apply the presentation of their choosing, should they require or desire.</p>


<h2>Media/Devices</h2>

<p>All page-body content should be properly formatted so as to be successfully rendered for both screen and print media. If necessary, graphical elements of the user interface used for screen media may be removed or replaced by more appropriate content for print. In some cases, information may be customized for handheld devices to provide a rich, handheld experience; otherwise, no specific support will be provided.</p>


<h2>Visual Media</h2>

<p>When available, transcripts of audio and video description are linked with multimedia files.</p>


<h2>Access Keys</h2>

<p>Access keys are special keyboard combinations that allow you to jump to specific parts of the screen. A global set of access keys is provided, and certain websites and applications may provide additional functionality.</p>
