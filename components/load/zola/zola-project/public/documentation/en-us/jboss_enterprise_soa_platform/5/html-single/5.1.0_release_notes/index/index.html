				In JBoss Developer Studio, BPEL projects could not be associated with the SOA runtime, which appeared disabled even when usable. Users were then incorrectly prompted to uninstall one of the current project facets. This issue has been resolved by adding the BPEL facet ID to JBoss Developer Studio, allowing users to select SOA as the targeted runtime.

				The soapui client failed to load multiple interfaces if authentication was required. This was because only the last interface contained the WSDL context that was loaded using the httpclient, and it is this httpclient that contained the authentication information. By doing so, it forced prior interfaces to reload using the UrlWsdlLoader. The UrlWsdlLoader did not know about the authentication as it instantiates its own httpclient. To fix this problem, a JBoss AOP aspect was created. This intercepts calls to soapUI's WsdlContext$Loader.getWsdlLoader() method so that the EsbWsdlLoader is always returned.
