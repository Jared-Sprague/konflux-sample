				Note that the 32-bit version of the Windows operating system is no longer a supported configuration. However, if you are continuing to run 32-bit Windows, it is worth being aware that with the default settings, very little memory in the process' address space for thread stack and other allocations (by default on Windows half of the address space is reserved for the system). This results in this type of error when you run SOA: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: requested 842040 bytes for Chunk::new. Out of swap space? To fix this, you can decrease heap or configure a smaller thread stack size (such as -Xss128k). You could also try to change the partitioning of the process space.

				The JackrabbitXmlNodeTypeRegistrationTest fails on the Solaris 9 platform. This is caused by the presence of an invalid character in an XML file which results in the system being unable to parse it. This could be encountered whenever any XML file is loaded. To fix this issue, you must edit the file in question to remove any invalid characters. An easy way to verify that XML files are valid is to open them in your web browser. If there is a problem, the browser will identify it for you.

				JBoss Rules does not support forward- or backward-compatability of any serialised formats. Versions of packages created in JBoss Rules 4.x are binary-incompatible with versions created in JBoss Rules 5.x For this reason the rebuild button was added to Rules. It is also why the client version must match the JBoss Rules version. To work around this problem, you must run with the same versions of the JARs on both the client and the server and, if you add news JARs to the server (regardless of the release) you must rebuild the packages.

				There is now a pluggable password encryption/decryption mechanism for the ESB's FilePassword. This is similar to how the FilePassword mechanism works in the JaasSecurityDomain mbean, but you can uses your own pluggable password encryption mechanism. For instance, in the jbossesb-properties, you can specify property name="org.jboss.soa.esb.services.security.publicKeystorePassword" value="testKeystorePassword" using your plugin implementation. This improves on the old implementation which was hard-coded and not pluggable.
