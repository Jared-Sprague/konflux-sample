<p>How do the Red Hat Enterprise Linux family members differ, and how do I know which one to use?</p>
<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can check the system by <code>cat /etc/redhat-release</code> to see which Red Hat Enterprise Linux family member is installed on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a technology viewpoint the three members of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux family, AS, ES &amp; WS, are very similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A design goal of the family is to maintain a high degree of commonality so that they provide a consistent environment for applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another advantage of this commonality is that the environment for users and system administrators is the same, regardless of the family member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of usage, AS and ES are designed for servers, while WS is designed for the desktop. AS and ES provide identical functionality: ES is licensed for x86 compatible servers with up to 2 CPUs and 8GB of main memory; AS is licensed for servers of any size and any architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the desktop product, WS supports x86, Itanium and AMD64 architectures, but does not include many of the open source server applications that are provided with AS and ES, so it is not suitable for server environments.</p>
</li>
